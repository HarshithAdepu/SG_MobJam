# Unity Puzzle Game README

## Overview

This is a Unity-based puzzle game where players slide colored blocks to designated exits to spawn NPCs, who then attack guards and a tower to complete the level. The game features a grid-based system with click-and-drag mechanics, AI pathfinding for NPCs, and a modular level design using ScriptableObjects.

## Technical Details

- **Unity Version**: 6000.0.30f1
- **Build**: Available in the releases section
- **Source**: Clone the project repository
- **Starting Scene**: Open the "MainMenu" scene
- **Play**: Enter Play Mode in Unity to start the game

## Features

- **Click-and-Drag Block Movement**: Move blocks by clicking and dragging them across the grid.
- **Exit Gates for NPC Spawning**: Blocks exiting through designated gates spawn NPCs based on their value.
- **AI Pathfinding for NPCs**: NPCs use Unityâ€™s NavMesh to pathfind towards guards and the tower.
- **ScriptableObjects for Levels**: Levels are stored in ScriptableObjects, allowing easy tweaking and potential JSON-based level loading in the future without rebuilding.
- **Custom Level Storage Tool**: Uses a custom tool (which was partially built by me) for level storage.

## Code Structure

- **GameManager**: Central controller for the scene, managing data communication between systems.
- **TowerManager**: Sets up the tower and its guards.
- **GridManager**: Spawns and manages the playable grid, including blocks and exits.
- **NPCManager**: Handles spawning and behavior of friendly NPCs that attack guards.
- **GameUIManager**: Manages the in-game UI elements.

## Short-Term Improvements

- Replace the current UI with a better asset pack.
- Add comments to code blocks for clarity.
- Improve camera positioning logic for better gameplay visibility.

## Long-Term Improvements

- Fix edge cases in exit logic (currently mitigated through level design).
- Address edge cases in exit gate spawning (also mitigated through level design).
- Rework guard selection logic to enhance gameplay appeal.
- Enable multiplication gates for exit mechanics (not supported in the current implementation).
